1) Tentatively, this tool will be run locally until we can dockerize the project and deploy it onto Microsoft Azure cloud

2) Make sure to install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) After download is done to ensure that versions are similar, if you cannot run `./run.sh` make sure to `chmod u+x run.sh` to give run commands from the terminal and then run `./run.sh`

4) After the running is complete you can open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to start annotating! Further instructions on how to annotate are detailed within the webpage

5) After generating the json upload it to the google drive for safe!
